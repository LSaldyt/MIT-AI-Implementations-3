# Notes

## Jeff Hawkins Style Perceptual Heirarchy

Specifically:

- Input as JSON, variable free.
- JSON structures with non-common elements turned to replaceable variables.
- Higher-level JSON structures with non-common trees turned to replaceable variables.
- ...
- Highest level perceptual tree structure

Data could be analyzed to an arbitrary number of levels, either until novel patterns no longer appear, or data runs out.

## Summary

Support for:

Objects, Concepts, etc
Event-based memory

Simple relationships, successorships, etc.

Add codelet/coderack structures -> obtain FARG framework.

## Composer

GUI for adding conceptual memories

Network like structure: scrollable, navigatable, really:

Simple nodes-links structure.

(Imagine, essentially, standing inside of someone else's brain)
